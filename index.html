    <p>Hi! I'm Charlie Sparrow from Utah. Iâ€™m currently taking WDD 130 because I want to become a full-stack developer and create apps that teach and inspire. I'm especially excited to learn HTML and CSS so I can build beautiful, useful websites for my own projects. I love storytelling through music, photography, and videography.</p>
